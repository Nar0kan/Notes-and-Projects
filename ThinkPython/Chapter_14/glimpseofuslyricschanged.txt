She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When i was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do i still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can i do? (ooh)
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'cause sometimes i look in her eyes
And that's where i find a glimpse of us
And i try to fall for her touch
But i'm thinking of the way it was
Said i'm fine and said i moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping i'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way i did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that i had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'cause sometimes i look in her eyes
And that's where i find a glimpse of us
And i try to fall for her touch
But i'm thinking of the way it was
Said i'm fine and said i moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping i'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'cause sometimes i look in her eyes
And that's where i find a glimpse of us
And i try to fall for her touch
But i'm thinking of the way it was
Said i'm fine and said i moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping i'll find
A glimpse of us
