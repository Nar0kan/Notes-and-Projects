					<h3>
						My biography
					</h3>
						<p> Hello! My name is Nikita, I'm 21 years old Ukrainian student. I have a cat, he's pretty wild to be honest. My family is not rich, but there is always something to eat and dress up. Being a child I was proactive and loved to explore everything. </p>
						<p> In the school I always had nice grades and tryed my best, but eventually burn out because of my own reasons. However, during my life as a student in Kyiv, some let's say 'part-time jobs' and different activities with friends it all remains in the past </p>
						<p> I've found my new dream and will definitelly achieve my goals on the way towards! Hope you stay motivational too! </p>

					<h3>
						Some advices
					</h3>
						<p> I think you might use some real advices that helped me during my depresion: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Trust yourself. Even if it is the main problem, try to convince yourself that this is the only way to live. We can survive different situation alone, but trusting in yourself will be handy to find true friends.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you struggle loneliness, are to shy or just more introvert than others - don't try to fight it alone. Consider visiting psychoterapevt, start doing various sport activities or just rethink if this is what really bothering you. Sometimes the problem is not in being an introvert, just in relationships between you with some groups of people.
							</li>
							<li>
								Drink more water, stay hydrated!
							</li>
							<li>
								Try to breath in correct ways, especially in stress situations. That will save you a lot of nerves in the future.
							</li>
							<li>
								Start your own diary and stick to it while you want to. Find your wicknesses and work on them.
							</li>
							<li>
								Don't put a smile on your self if you are not feeling it. Just be yourself. Even if noone accept you right now it doesn't matter you won't find right people in the future.
							</li>
						</ul>
