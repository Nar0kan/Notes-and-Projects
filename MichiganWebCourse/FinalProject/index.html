					  	<img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Photo with my face">

					  	<p> Hello! My name is Nikita. I am 21, a male, Ukrainian student. I'm a nice person, but sometimes too closed inside. Don't take it as insults, please. My qualities are: self-motivational, organized, collaborative, resourceful, and adaptable. </p>

					<br>

					<h4 id="item-1-1">Childhood & Life</h4>
					  	<p> I have a cat, and he's pretty wild, to be honest. My family is not rich, but there is always something to eat and dress up. Being a child, I was proactive and loved to explore everything. </p>

						<p> In school, I always had good grades and tried my best, but burnt out because of my reasons. However, my life as a student in Kyiv, some, let's say, 'part-time jobs' and different activities with friends helped me, and the pain remains in the past. </p>

						<p> I've found my new dream and will achieve goals on the way toward it! I hope you stay motivational too! </p>
				  	
				  	<br>

				  	<h4 id="item-1-2">Education</h4>
				  		<p> <i>2008-2018</i> High School grade at 'Gymnasium named after Lesya Ukrainka' </p>
						<p> <i>2018-2023</i> Bachelaour grade at 'National Aviation University' (125, Cybersecurity)</p>
						<p> <i>2019-2022</i> Cisco courses CCNA pt.1-3 </p>
						<p> <i>2023</i> Courses by Michigan University at Coursera - 'Web-design for everybody' (HTML/CSS/JS) </p>

				    <h3 id="item-2">Goals in life</h3>
					    <p> Currently, I am trying to apply for a web developer job. My working experience is still transparent, so I want to fill it up with some light. My ambitions are high, and I will try my best to achieve my goals in life. There are a few I can share with you </p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Become a programmer	
							</li>
							<li>
								Move to Japan
							</li>
							<li>
								Support Ukraine, even from abroad and especially after Our Victory
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							I want to become a web developer because this job is highly-paid and is pretty interactive in terms of approaches to performing tasks.
						</p>

					<hr>

				    <h3 id="item-3">Hobbies & Habbits</h3>
				    	<p> My hobbies are: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Gaming (I like to play time-to-time in different genres of games)
							</li>
							<li>
								Japanese culture (Sometimes I am really into Japanese cultural phenomena, like nice manners, architecture, anime, the shogun epoch, the imperial period, and more)
							</li>
							<li>
								Creating something useful or new (I always do my best to be valuable to whom or to what I love and admire)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p> I don't have bad habits, simply because they won't help me anyway. That is why I switched to a healthy lifestyle (gym, hydration, and nutritious meal). </p>
